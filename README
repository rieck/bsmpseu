  BSMpseu pseudonymizes records from Solaris BSM audit trail files. 
  Personal data such as user IDs, group IDs, etc. is replaced with
  pseudonyms, so that the generated output doesn't reveal private
  information about the system's users, but still preserves a maximum of
  integrity and consistency.


  Installation is a straigh-forward process. 
  
    $ ./configure
    $ make 
    # make install
  
  For details on the program options see the provided man page

    $ man bsmpseu

  Have fun, 
  Konrad Rieck
